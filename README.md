# A JavaScript Crash Course - JS In Plain English on Medium.com
## Supplementary Files
***
Hello and welcome to the official GitHub repository of examples
and exercises from my JavaScript Crash Course Article Series
published by *JavaScript In Plain English* on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/).
### About
Every article (except for the optional ones) has code examples which
are in this repo in their respective folders in order of publication.
For example, the second article's examples are in the `examples/02_data_types/` 
directory.

Exercises and solutions are in their own folder as well (`exercises/` and `exercises/solutions/`). 

To run these code files, I suggest you use [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
***
I sincerely appreciate my readers and hope this repo will be of great
value to them.

Information and changes will be added to this README as needed.
Feel free to fork or make pull requests!

*Thank you!*
